<br>

<strong>Chapter One: </strong>

You woke up and found yourself in a room with only two doors, green and red, you should choose one of them.<br> <br>

<strong> Chapter Three: </strong>

After you find the dead body in the green door, you will either choose to scream or to hold your nerves.
But if you entered the red door, after the guard appears, you will have to choose between using the gun or using the piece of metal in order to defend yourself. <br><br>



<strong> Chapter Four: </strong>

In the red door, when using the gun, you will make a loud noise, but if you use the metal and hit the guard, you will be able to search him and find some keys.<br><br>



<strong> Chapter Five: </strong>

In the green door, after following the hall way, in order to reach the exit, you will choose to run fast or to walk slowly. 

In the red door, if you made a loud noise by using the gun, kidnappers will attack you and you will get killed, while if you get the keys from the guard after hurting him with the metal you will have to choose between opening the door, or searching for more clues.<br><br>



<strong> Chapter Six: </strong>

In the green door, if you choose to run fast, you will make noise and get the kidnapper’s attention and you will be dead. But if you walked slowly and silently through the hallway you will find a group of people inside the room.
